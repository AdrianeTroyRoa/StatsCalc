# StatsCalc
Final project for CC 11.0

## Introduction
Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, description, analysis, and inference of conclusions from quantitative data. The mathematical theories behind statistics rely heavily on differential and integral calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory. Statisticians, people who do statistics, are particularly concerned with determining how to draw reliable conclusions about large groups and general events from the behavior and other observable characteristics of small samples. These small samples represent a portion of the large group or a limited number of instances of a general phenomenon.

Calculating statistics manually and mentally may take time. It even takes time to calculate it using a basic calculator. This is due to the fact that one needs to consider formulas carefully and correctly to arrive at a certain statistical result. This can be resolved through Scientific Calculators. These calculators have the ability to solve some of these formulas autonomously. However, such calculators may be too costly to perform simple sample statistical calculations.

In order to cater to these challenges, the group aims to make a GUI Java Application that performs simple statistical calculations.
