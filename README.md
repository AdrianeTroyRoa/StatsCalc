## StatsCalc
Final project for CC 11.0

#Introduction

There are a variety of calculators that we can use to this today
each has it's own function that help us compute numbers
from Abacus to Calculators that uses electricity.

We have scientific calculators that most of us are using,
this calculator includes exponents, log, naturallog (ln), trig functions, and memory. 
These functions are vital when you're working with scientific notation or any formula with a geometry component. Basic calculators can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, description, analysis, and inference of conclusions from quantitative data. The mathematical theories behind statistics rely heavily on differential and integral calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory. Statisticians, people who do statistics, are particularly concerned with determining how to draw reliable conclusions about large groups and general events from the behavior and other observable characteristics of small samples. These small samples represent a portion of the large group or a limited number of instances of a general phenomenon.


Calculating statistics manually and mentally may take time, it even takes time to calculate it while using a basic caclulator 
through java application 
the programmers decided to make a statistics caclulator to solve a simple sample problem of statistics effectively and efficiently.  
The programmers made this application intended only for solving:
Mean
Median
Mode
Variance
standard Deviation
etc..

The purpose of this calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently. It is clear that a calculator should relieve the user of the need to do mental operations and of the need to rely on paper, so far as possible.
The program will undergo a series of sample problem of statistics to test the function of the program.


#Methodology

This section will discuss the process of making of the statistic caculator application

#Results

This section will talk about the result of the statistics caculator on solving a samples of problem
