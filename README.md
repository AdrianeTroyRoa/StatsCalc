# StatsCalc
Final project for CC 11.0

Introduction
There are a variety of calculators that we can use to this today
each has it's own function that help us compute numbers
from Abacus to Calculators that uses electricity.

We have scientific calculators that most of us are using,
this calculator includes exponents, log, naturallog (ln), trig functions, and memory. 
These functions are vital when you're working with scientific notation or any formula with a geometry component. Basic calculators can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
But, ever wonder if we could have a calculator that solves statistics?
Presenting the Statistics Calculator
The programmers made this application intended only for solving:
Mean
Median
Mode
Variance
standard Deviation
etc..

The programmers purposely made this program to make it easy to solve a problem
dealing with statistics. 
The purpose of this calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently. It is clear that a calculator should relieve the user of the need to do mental operations and of the need to rely on paper, so far as possible.
Its a simple program but, we the programmers think it is a big help to 
everyone, making the calculations quick and easy.
